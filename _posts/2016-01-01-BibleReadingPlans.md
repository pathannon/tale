<h2>Happy New Year!</h2>
What are your resolutions this year?
There’s a good chance you plan to read the bible more this year.
As you planed last year.

It’s a good resolution. God told Joshua that the path to prosperity and success includes daily study of God’s word.  
<br>`
<blockquote>Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. - Joshua 1:8</blockquote>  
<br>`
Someone wise said, “Those who fail to plan, plan to fail.” (It may have been Benjamin Franklin. Or Winston Churchill. Or somebody’s business prof.) You need a plan to move your intentions into actions. A bible reading plan can help you succeed in your intention to read the bible more this year.
